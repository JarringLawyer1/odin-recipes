    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>2 cups cold water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp plus 3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>4 to 6 cups vegetable or peanut oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups app-purpose-flour</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp accent flavor enhancer</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 cup best quality mayonnaise</li>
            <li>3 tbs store bought bbq sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp dijon mustard</li>
            <li>6 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>bread and butter pickles</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the chicken: One at a time, place the chicken breasts in a resealable freezer bag; using a meat mallet or rolling pin, pound them to an even ¼-inch thickness. Cut each pounded breast in half. (If the pieces seem too large to fit in a bun, trim off the pointy ends; you can cook those as chicken nuggets at the same time you're cooking the breasts.)</li>
            <li>Pour the cold water into a medium bowl; add the 2 tablespoons of the salt and the sugar and whisk until dissolved. Place the chicken breasts in the brine, cover the bowl, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight (the longer you brine, the saltier the chicken will be).</li>
            <li>Line a plate with a few layers of paper towels and set it next to the stove. Pour the oil into a large, high-sided pot or Dutch oven until it reaches a depth of about 1 inch. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering (about 350°F). (If the end of a wooden spoon or cube of bread sizzles vigorously when you dip it in, the oil is hot enough.)</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and milk until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>In another medium bowl, whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, garlic powder, pepper, Accent, paprika, and the remaining ¾ teaspoon salt. Drizzle 4 tablespoons of the egg mixture into the flour mixture and mix with a fork until the flour mixture is evenly clumpy.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy cleanup. Remove the chicken from the brine and pat dry with paper towels. One at a time, dip each breast into the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off, and then into the flour mixture, turning a few times and pressing firmly so that the clumps adhere. Set the breaded chicken on the lined baking sheet and repeat with the remaining breasts.</li>
            <li>Carefully place a few pieces of breaded chicken into the hot oil without crowding the pot. Cook, turning a few times, until golden brown and crispy on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes total. Place the cooked chicken on the paper towel-lined plate to drain. Fry the remaining breasts in the same manner, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature of the oil.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayoanniase, barbecue sauce, and mustard.</li>
            <li>Assemble the sandwiches: Spread some of the sauce on each top and bottom bun. Top each bottom bun with a piece of crispy chicken and a few pickles. Close the sandwiches and serve immediately.</li>
